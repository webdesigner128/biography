IT BROUGHT A LOT OF FAME BUT RATHER THEN ACHIEVING THIS OR CLEARING JEE ADVANCED WHAT I TREASURE THE MOST IS THE VALUES WHICH I LEARNT DURING THE JOURNEY. IT IS LONG LASTING AND WILL HELP ME IN REACHING GREATER HEIGHTS IN TIMES TO COME.MY FIRST YEAR IS FILLED A LOT OF MEMORIES AND JOYFUL MOMENTS.LATER PANDEMIC KICKED IN AND RUINED MY COLLEGE LIFE.WILL CONTINUE AS I HAVE TO LEARN A LOT OF NEW THING AND TIME IS LESS.</P>
