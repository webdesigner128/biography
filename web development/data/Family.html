<center><h1> MOTHER AND FATHER</h1></center>
<p> HERE IS MY MOTHER AND FATHER FROM WHERE WE DERIVE ALL OUR VALUES.THERE IS ALWAYS CONFLICT IN EVERY FAMILY BUT SHIP KEEPS AFLOAT.I CAN PERSONALLY SAY MY MOM HAS A LOT OF ROLE IN SUCCESS OF LIFE. SHE HAS WORKED TIREDLESSLY FOR MY SUCCESS.IF I AM MENTALLY SO STRONG AND ACADEMICALLY STRONG ,IT WAS ALL DUE TO CONSTANT SUPPORT FROM MY MOTHER. FATHER WAS CONCERNED LARGELY TOWARDS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND THIS IS MOST HOSTLY DEBATED AMONGST MY MOTHER AND FATHER.</p>

<p>MY FAMILY CONSISTS OF TWO ELDER SISTERS AND ONE ELDER BROTHER.ME BEING THE YOUNGEST IS MOST NAUGHTY AND LOVED BY ALL ELDERS.</p>

<p>MY ELDER BUT NOT THE ELDEST SISTER IS VERY FUNNY AND I HAVE SPENT MOST OF MY LIFETIME WITH HER ONLY.I CRACK A LOT OF JOKES ON HER AND SHE DOES NOT TAKE IT BY HEART.SHE IS ALSO GOOD IN STUDIES AND HAS NOT REALISED HER FULL POTENTIAL TILL DATE.SHE TAKES FULL RESPONSIBILITY OF FAMILY WHEN MOM IS MISSING IN ACTION.I HOPE SHE CAN ACHIEVE HER GOAL AND LIVE A HAPPY LIFE WHICH SHE RIGHTLY DESERVED.</p>

<p>THEN COMES MY MOST LOVING AND HELPFUL ELDER BROTHER MANISH BHAIYA.HE IS THE BEST THING WHICH HAS HAPPENED IN MY LIFE SO FAR.HE IS THE MOST SUPPORTING IN MY FAMILY AND SPEND MOST OF CHILDHOOD WITH.HE IS BIT LAZY AND BASICALLY PROCASTINATE A LOT. HE IS ACADEMICALLY GOOD BUT HE IS LIKE A FROG IN POND WHO IS UNAWARE OF STIFF COMPETITON OUTSIDE.HE NEEDS TO HAVE FIRE IN HIS BELLY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING BIGGER.</p>
