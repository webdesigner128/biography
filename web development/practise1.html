<p> One of the pleasures of the Internet is the ease with which you can find economic data. We repeat our earlier suggestion that to start looking for almost everything, the best site is “Resources for Economists on the Internet,”  www.aeaweb.org/RFE . An excellent site for U.S. macroeconomic data,  http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2  has links to over 20,000 series and will plot data for you as well as provide easy downloads. The official source for U.S. national income accounts is the Bureau of Economic Analysis at  www.bea.gov . You can also find the  Survey of Current Business  online at this site. The  Economic Report of the President,  including data tables and past issues, is available at  www.gpoaccess.gov/eop . The website  www.data.gov  serves as a portal to a wide array of U.S. government data.   Statistics Canada is the right place to look for Canadian data,  www.statcan.gc.ca/ start-debut-eng.html  (ou pour Statistique Canada,  www.statcan.ca/menu-fr.htm ). The Statistical Office of the European Union,  epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu , is a good source for European data. American (North and South) data are provided by the Inter-American Development Bank at  www.iadb.org/research . The World Bank is an excellent source of data on developing countries; see w ww.worldbank.org/data.  The NBER provides a set of pre–World War II data for several countries at  www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/ contents/index.html .</p>  <br>
